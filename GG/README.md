# Labs. GG

GG – linked list with elements of unit-testing and exception handling.

The same assignment, as in G, it’s solution (a) should be complemented by two additional elements:

x) at least one of the data checkings should be implemented using exception handling,

y) at least one of the function (preferably, the central one) should be unit-tested, at least three test cases should be provided; for that purpose (1) this function should be put in a separate file (to function main), (2) you should create another project just for unit-testing (so, the regular project, and testing project). Tips: the last lab work of the previous semester (about classes) with hard-coded main function is very close to the concept of such a unit-testing project.
