# Lab. G20

Create two programs in C++ to process sequences of values in two ways:
1) implementing it through a linked list, using dynamic data structures,
2) using STL::list.
   In both implementations, a specific function to process values should be created and presented in action (showing both initial and resulting values). In the case of linked-list, also auxiliary functions should be created and allocated memory for the structure should be freed.

G20. Create function to insert element with value n after first element with value m. Input from keyboard m and n as well all values in list.
